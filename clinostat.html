<h1>Clinostat Microgravity Simulation</h1>

<p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Mechanical Designer</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Fusion 360, MATLAB, 3D printing additive Manufacturing</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Design a rotating mechanical system capable of simulating microgravity conditions
for biological research while maintaining balance and structural integrity. 
The entire assembly must cost less then 400$ total including prototyping. 
The final design must be able to run for two weeks strait without stopping.

</p>

<h2>Engineering Approach</h2>
<p>
Key constraints included rotational stability, manufacturability, and ease of assembly.
Design iterations focused on mass balance and rotational symmetry, as well as 
longevity.
</p>
  
<h2>Analysis & Validation</h2>
<p>
Design decisions were supported by mechanical reasoning and iterative testing.
Future work would include increasing the effective lifespan of the system and making
the entire system more professional.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
The final system met functional requirements and was delivered for experimental use.

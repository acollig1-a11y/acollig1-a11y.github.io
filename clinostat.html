<h1>Clinostat Microgravity Simulation</h1>

<p><strong>Role:</strong> Lead Mechanical Designer</p>
<p><strong>Tools:</strong> Fusion 360, MATLAB, Manufacturing</p>

<h2>Problem Statement</h2>
<p>
Design a rotating mechanical system capable of simulating microgravity conditions
for biological research while maintaining balance and structural integrity.
</p>

<h2>Engineering Approach</h2>
<p>
Key constraints included rotational stability, manufacturability, and ease of assembly.
Design iterations focused on mass balance and rotational symmetry.
</p>

<h2>Analysis & Validation</h2>
<p>
Design decisions were supported by mechanical reasoning and iterative testing.
Future work would include vibration analysis and motor characterization.
</p>

<h2>Outcome</h2>
<p>
The final system met functional requirements and was delivered for experimental use.
